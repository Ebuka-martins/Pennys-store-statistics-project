# PENNY'S SALES DATA PREDICTION PROGRAMMING
This Python program automates the process of predicting and managing yearly sales data for Penny's store. By integrating with Google Sheets, the program allows the user to input sales data for six different product categories and predict future sales based on a small random variance. The historical sales data for products like Jeans, Trousers, Shoes, Perfumes, Polo, and Knickers is tracked in a Google Sheets worksheet. The program updates this worksheet by adding new sales predictions, which are generated using historical data and random variations.
